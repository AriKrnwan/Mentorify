        I would describe myself as a self-motivated individual to keep growing, love new challenges, has the ability to survive in all situations, problem solver, logical thinker, and able to work with team or individually.Now I'm exploring further and deeper about myself, but my mindset is that we don't have to be great first to start trying new things.I'd love to expand my knowledge in the field of digital and technology development especially web development, and now I'm focusing on frontend with reactjs.Actually full stack wanna be.
